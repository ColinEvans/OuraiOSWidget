  <li><b>App-only:</b> Data and tokens are stored on your device (Keychain/local storage). No server stores your data.</li>
  <li><b>With backend:</b> Webhook payloads and/or tokens may be stored on our infrastructure 
  (e.g., Cloudflare KV/D1) to deliver data to the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell or share your data with third parties. Data may be processed by our service providers 
(e.g., Cloudflare) strictly to run the app.</p>

<h2>Retention & Deletion</h2>
<p>We keep data only as long as needed for the app to function. 
You can revoke access at any time through Oura’s account settings, or request deletion by contacting us.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use platform storage (e.g., iOS Keychain) and HTTPS. No method is 100% secure; use at your own risk.</p>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Revoke Oura access at any time in Oura settings.</li>
